This is MakoAgent project. It is built as a standalone 3d printing monitoring, print quality improvement assitent and calibration tool.
First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files.
The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. 
Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
Create a file where you document all the features we create, its stage of development and read it before moving forward in order not to work on something we solved already.
